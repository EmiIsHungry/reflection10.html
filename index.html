  <h1> Emily's Reflection #10 </h1>
  <body>
    <p> I have some experience in making games in godot but this is new to me to make it in html and github. I really like making games but I wish, we had more time than a week since I need more ideas and time to put them all together. I’m sorry if the game seem rushed since it’s finals week but I really tried to make it funny and interactive. I love this way of making games since it makes you have to take noticed and use your brain to put the html links together and connect them. The challenges I faced are that it gets confusing when you have more than one ending and seeing if the links works. I learned that you need lot of planning to make it really good and I shouldn’t over think it lot. </p>

    <p> But, I had fun and love it. Everything I do in this class, I love it. I learn lot from making link and make it easier for the players to play. The challenges is also going back to the other choices so I made every ending can lead back to other choices. It makes it easier for me and the players. I hope to gain more story telling so I can make my games great and fun for everyone. The experiences I got from this was that making games in other places helps me learn other languages which I am thankful for. Since lot of game developments, they use lot of different languages and places so it looks better if you know lot of the codes in more than one way.
